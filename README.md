# llparser-in-python
---
This was the mini project of 3 credit course Compiler design. Well we had one week before the submission date, so anyhow we needed out 15 marks. Hence, Someone downloaded the code from somewhere, someone modified the code with some library, and our group member again modified some part and hence we present this project as our own work, and resource is google. But yeah, we have idea about every function that goes within this file. 


Programming is python is not that hard.
